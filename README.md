# Video Composition Sample

## This is not an officially supported Google product

## About
The aim of this project is to:
 * Demonstrate a possible approach to provide basic video composition operations on Android and
 Chrome OS including: multiplexing 4 video streams, rotation/transparency/colour filter effects,
 with export to a mp4 file.
 * Provide a base for testing media decoding/muxing/encoding performance with various file sizes and
 types

The video composition sample decodes 4 video streams, applies optional effects to each one -
rotation, transparency, scaling, colour filters, speed up, slow down - combines them in a realtime
preview. An export option for the composition is also provided.

### Notes/Caveats
 * Effects are configured in MediaCompositionConfig.kt by setting a list of TrackEffects with start
 and duration and effect parameters.
 * Currently video clips are assumed to have a framerate set. Clips without a framerate will cause
 a crash on decode.
 * The media files included with this project are large (~600mb in total). To checkout this repo
 please use: [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Install git-lfs then run `git lfs install`.
